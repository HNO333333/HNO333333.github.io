(to be filled: some command that frequently used for building this blog)


* sync: `npx quartz sync`
* preview locally: `npx quartz build --serve`
* how to use obsidian mobile
	* download
	* generate a personal auth token (from setting/dev op/fine-grained pat)
	* then, there you go! password doesn't work here! (however, the private authentification token will expire at some point so you may need to update it regularly?)
